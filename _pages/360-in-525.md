# 360-in-525 Minutes CIM Course Set in Data Sciences -- Introduction

**For PhD or MSc Students at Uppsala University, Spring 2018**


There will be several full-day (360 minutes-long, with usual breaks) workshop-style 1hp to 3hp courses supported by the Centre for Interdisciplinary Mathematics jointly with the Department of Mathematics in Spring 2018 by domain experts in Digital Sociology, Geospatial Analytics, Population Genetics and Mathematical Statistics. 

This course set is coordinated by Dr. Raazesh Sainudiin at the Department of Mathematics, Uppsala University. 
If you are a PhD or MSc student at Uppsala University, please  register for appropriate subsets of the course set by emailing the course set coordinator with subject line '360-in-525'. 

Feel free to take any subset of modules if you can satisfy the prerequisite modules. Physical presence is mandatory for the credits in all of these modules.

# CIM course 1 - Introduction to Apache Spark for Data Scientists
This is a one-full-day workshop (1 hp) on **April 20 2018** on [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) one of the most widely used open-source software for analysing big data in industry and academia. 

# CIM course 2 - Social Media and Big Data
This is a two-full-days workshop (2 hp) on **April 26-27 2018**. Prerequisites: CIM course 1 or 'Introduction to data Science (the Fall 2017 course)'. The first day will be an introduction to the domain by Professor Simon Lindgren,a digital sociologist from Umea: http://www.simonlindgren.com/ and the second day will build towards making one's own twitter experimental design in real-time. 
We will formalise notions like the 'Where Am I? Operator' in a given 'population ideological tree or forest' of retweet networks and try digesting gdelt global news streams, if time permits. 


# CIM course 3 - Geospatial Analytics on Big Data 
This is a two-full-days workshop (2 hp) on **May 3-4 2018**. Prerequisites: CIM course 1  or 'Introduction to data Science'. The first day will be done by domain experts from UU's Department of Cultural Geography: http://katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N2-980 with tutorials on non-distributed geospatial analytics and the second day will be on scalable distributed versions.

# CIM course 4 - Mathematical, Statistical and Computational Foundations for Data Scientists
 
Three-full-day workshops (3 hp) on **May 11, 18 and 25 2018**. Prerequisites: current proficiency in high-school level mathematics (pre-calculus and algebra with some programming experience beyond Excel). Target Audience: any MSc or PhD student at UU who wants to understand the mathematical statistical foundations in the data scientist's computational toolbox. Topics will include: Sets, Maps, Functions, Modular Arithmetic, Axiomatic Probability, Conditional probability, Pseudo-random constructive understanding of random variables and structures including graphs, Statistics, Likelihood Principle, Bayes Rule, Decisions (parametric and non-parametric) including tests and estimators, Markov chains and their pseudorandom constructions, etc. We will use SageMath/python locally and collaborate in COCALC in lab/lectures.

# CIM course 5 - Population Genetics and Big Data 

Two-full-day workshops (2 hp) on **May 31 and June 1 2018**. Prerequisites: (CIM course 1  or 'Introduction to data Science') and (CIM course 4 or equivalent). The first day will be on the basic theories in current population genetics and genomics. The second day will use ADAM and possibly Hail over Apache Spark.

# CIM course 0 - Mathematical Statistical  Learning Theory Series: An L1 View

Meeting time is TBA via doodle. 

This course will introduce a PhD student in mathematics or mathematical statistics to one of the fundamental problems at the very core of various probabilistic theories of decision-making.  
We will mainly focus on the relation between the combinatorial geometric complexity of the (sigma) algebras of a simple measurable space and the rates of convergence of empirical measures over them in one of the simplest posable decision problems -- *nonparametric density estimation* of an unkown density f in L1 based on finitely many observations drawn independenty from it, but without making any mathematical compromise whatsoever, and thereby giving the so-called *universal performance guarantee* . 

This course was given in another form at CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France for PhD students in mathematics there. Students in Geometry and Combinatorial probability as well as analysis may find this course insightful for their own research, as one of the basic theorems involves the combined use of several unique inequalities in a specific partial order of implications.

The emphasis will involve constructive mathematics and perhaps delve into tree arithmetics towards such decision with universal performance guarantees along with their combinatorial, algebraic and analytic properties if time permits. Unfortunately such guarantees are not available for big data sets and are sorely needed for being able to impose legal requirements and standards on automated decision-making systems.

# LOGISTICS:
Please block the dates if you are considering taking them and pass it to other mates of yours who may want to do some subset of these modules. There is no TA support or fika planned during the breaks, so bring enough water, cookies, tea, etc during the three 15 minute breaks before and after lunch. For all courses except CIM Course 0, you are expected to bring a laptop that is not older than 3 years (in general) with wireless access (details on the needed disk space and RAM will partly depend on which modules are being taken.  
Effort is underway to make the hardware requirements on the laptop minimal -- any typical Mac, Linux or Windows laptops you use for your research is expected to suffice).
