excerpt: 'At the interface of computing, mathematics and statistics.<br /><br /><br />'

Research at LaMaStEx is at the interdisciplinary interface of computing, mathematics and statistics. 
We use computer arithmetic and combinatorial data-structures through custom-built mathematical and statistical models to rigorously solve numerical optimization and simulation problems that arise in statistical decision-making from real-world data.

# My Personal Mathematical Journey

by Raazesh Sainudiin

This is meant for live interactive presentation to students in a mathematical club at Uppsala University.

# Brief Geospatal Historical Trajectory in Schooling/Working

* 1991 - left India for Minnesota as Count Folke Bernadotte Memorial Scholar to Gustavus Adolphus College
* was deeply troubled by the experiential awareness of the relativity of loclaly co-fabricated cosmologies
* dropped out from Mathematics and COmputer Science major and switched to Philosohpy and Religion
* dropped out of College and lived in the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and the Black Hills of South Dakota for a couple years
* finished double major in Biology and Mathematics at Minnesotta State University
* Went to Cornell University to study Plant Pathology
* switched to MS in Biometrics
* switched to PhD in Mathematical Staitstics
* first Post Doc in Mathematics, Dept of Maths, Cornell Univ, USA
* second Postdoc in Statistical genetics, Dept of Stats, Oxford Univ., Oxford, UK
* permanent position Lecturer/Senior Lecturer in New Zealand, Univ of Canterbury 2007-2016
* took an industrial R&D detour in 2015
* now here at maths Department at UU and working in Stockholm as consultant once a week
