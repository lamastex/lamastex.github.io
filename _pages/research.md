Research at LaMaStEx is at the interdisciplinary interface of mathematics, computing and statistics. 
We use computer arithmetic and combinatorial data-structures through custom-built mathematical and statistical models to rigorously solve numerical optimization and simulation problems that arise in statistical decision-making from real-world data.
