# Overview of a 360-in-525 Minutes Course Set in Data Sciences, Spring 2018

**For PhD Students at Uppsala University and Researchers who want to upskill for Data Industry**


There will be several full-day workshop-style courses (360 minutes-long, with the usual three 15-minutes-long breaks before and after the 75-minutes-long lunch break in the 525 minutes from 0815 to 1700 hours CET) worth 1hp to 3hp credits each. 
This is partly supported by the Centre for Interdisciplinary Mathematics jointly with the Department of Mathematics in Spring 2018 and taught by domain experts in Digital Sociology, Geospatial Analytics, Population Genetics and Mathematical Statistics. 

Master students at Uppsala University must contact their study councellor in order to see if it is possible to take the course as a "Selected Topics Course" in their Department.

If you are working in industry and want to upskill in data science then you can take the courses (free of cost) and receive a certificate from the Department of Mathematics upon successful completion.

# 360-in-525-1: Introduction to Apache Spark for Data Scientists
This is a one-full-day workshop (1 hp) on **April 20 2018** on [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), one of the most widely used open-source and commercially friendly software for analysing big data in industry and academia. 
A crash course in Scala, the language of Apache Spark, will be followed by introduction to resilient distributed datasets (RDDs), their transformations and actions, Spark DataSets and DataFrames, SparkSQL.  We will have brief teasers on ML Pipelines, Streaming and GraphX as they will be covered in-depth in the sequel modules (concepts will be fortified by auto-graded homework assignments).

This is a two-full-days workshop (2 hp) on **April 26-27 2018**. Prerequisites: 360-in-525-1 or [Introduction to data Science](https://lamastex.github.io/scalable-data-science/sds/2/2/) (the Fall 2017 UU inter-faculty course). The first day will be an introduction to the domain by [Professor Simon Lindgren, a digital sociologist from Umea](http://www.simonlindgren.com/) and the second day will build towards making one's own twitter experimental designs in real-time. 
This module will introduce you to topic modeling and other simple pipelines in natural language processing.  
The course will give you the basic skills needed to go further and investigate the influence, if any, of [micro propaganda machines](https://medium.com/@d1gi/the-election2016-micro-propaganda-machine-383449cc1fba) (as shown below) or other similar opinion engineering operations, for instance. We may try digesting [gdelt project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) of global news streams with embeddings and models.

# 360-in-525-0: Mathematical Statistical  Learning Theory Series; An L1 View

Meeting time for this 1-day-workshop is TBA via doodle. 

This course will introduce a PhD student in mathematics or mathematical statistics to one of the fundamental problems at the very core of various probabilistic theories of decision-making.  
We will mainly focus on the relation between the combinatorial geometric complexity of the (sigma) algebras of a simple measurable space and the rates of convergence of empirical measures over them in one of the simplest posable decision problems -- *nonparametric density estimation* of an unknown density f in L1 based on finitely many observations drawn independently from it, but without making any mathematical compromise whatsoever, and thereby giving the so-called *universal performance guarantee* . 

This course was given in another form at CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France for PhD students in mathematics there. Students in Geometry and Combinatorial probability as well as analysis may find this course insightful for their own research, as one of the basic theorems involves the combined use of several unique inequalities in a specific partial order of implications.

The emphasis will involve constructive mathematics and perhaps delve into tree arithmetics towards such decision with universal performance guarantees along with their combinatorial, algebraic and analytic properties if time permits. Unfortunately such guarantees are not available for big data sets and may be necessary for being able to impose legal requirements and standards on automated decision-making systems.

# LOGISTICS
Please block the dates if you are considering taking them and pass it to other mates of yours who may want to do some subset of these modules. There is no TA support or fika planned during the breaks, so bring enough water, cookies, tea, etc during the three 15 minute breaks before and after lunch. For all courses except 360-in-525-0, you are expected to bring a laptop that is not older than 3 years (in general) with wireless access (details on the needed disk space and RAM will partly depend on which modules are being taken.  
Effort is underway to make the hardware requirements on the laptop minimal -- any typical Mac, Linux or Windows laptops you use for your research is expected to suffice).
Please join [Uppsala Big Data Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Uppsala-Big-Data-Meetup/) to receive communications on course logistics and partake in discussions.

# Industrial sponsors for fika are being sought

We are currently seeking Swedish industrial sponsors to keep our brains hydrated, caffeinated, and sugary! 

Swedish industries that want to optimise their operations based on data at their disposal, especially in geospatial analytics, security, recommender systems, health care, and other areas can help with the preparation of their potential employees. Such employees who want to upskill in data sciences can freely attend the full-day workshop style courses in Uppsala.

We expect over a dozen keen students on each workshop day, except the mathematical course, and may need at least 1000 sek for each of the two fikas on each day out of the 11 days in total (sponsorships can be as low as 1000 sek and in return we will spend time trying to formally relate the appropriate parts of the lecture, at the right mathematical juncture, to problems in your industry with an emphasis on your industry's pressing needs and skill-sets - this gives great advertisement for your company, freely train your employees and can inspire students to continue with research internships at your company in the near future).
