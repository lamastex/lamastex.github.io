**LaMaStEx** is a **La**boratory for **Ma**thematical **St**atistical **Ex**periments that is coordinated by Raazesh Sainudiin.

At LaMaStEx, we work at the interface of computing, mathematics and statistics. 
This interdisciplinary research, development and training work aims broadly to use computers to solve real-world problems.

### More Details

More specifically, our research uses computer arithmetic and combinatorial data-structures through custom-built mathematical and statistical models to rigorously solve numerical optimization and simulation problems that arise in statistical decision-making from real-world data. Our research-led development and training uses the most appropriate open-source technologies.

We have worked on theoretical and practical aspects of a range of real-world decision problems from population genetics, phylogenetics, ecological genetics, air-traffic management, identification and control of gas turbines, natural language processing, collaborative filtering, terrorism studies, statistical physics of complex fluids, cross-domain data-fusion and knowledge-graph extractions for security-related applications, nonparametric self-exciting point processes on networks for crime-risk prediction, scalable geospatial computing of GPS trajectories on OpenStreetMaps, models of transmissions on networks and their inference for meme evolution from Twitter streams, classical problems in nonparametric density estimation, etc.
