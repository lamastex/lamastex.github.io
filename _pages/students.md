Several students have completed their advanced degrees under the supervision of Raazesh Sainudiin. 
A list of current and former students is given below.


Prospective MS or PhD Student
------------------------------

You may pursue research under my supervision in an area of mutual
interest. Drop by my office for a chat if you are interested. You are
welcome to send me a statement of purpose, a written research report (if
available) and CV if you are not in Uppsala, Sweden.

Here is a subset of the following possible PhD topics:

1. Mathematical models of meme evolution and their scalable statistical
    inference from global twitter streams in Apache Spark
2. Scalable machine-learning and nonparametric methods in Apache Spark
3. Scalable computer-aided proofs in Apache Spark
4. Set-valued Mathematics, Applied Interval Analysis
5. Randomized Set-valued Algorithms
6. Nonparametric Statistical Methods with Recursively Computable
   Statistical Information Structures
7. Mathematical Genetics: Combinatorial Stochastic Processes in
    Molecular Genetics
