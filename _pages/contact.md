<!--
- need to give com g-cal permissions (make availabe to public 'see only free/busy'; share with specific people: raaz's gmail.com with 'see only free/busy') to be able to embed into academic Xim calendar and then here... 
- have to add the final course timetables as static ical downloaded from time-edit and uploaded to academic Raaz's Xim Calendar in g-cal
- keep the live subscription to timeedit in the calendar but do not embed it as this does not have the option to 'make availabe to public with 'see only free/busy', but still important in case schedule changes...
