by Raazesh Sainudiin

This is meant for a live interactive presentation to students in a mathematical club at Uppsala University.

# Outline

* [00 - My Personal mathematical Journey](/talks/2017/12/12_myMathJourney/)
* [01 - Brief Trajectory in Schooling/Working](/talks/2017/12/12_myMathJourney/01/)
* [02 - Formative Years](/talks/2017/12/12_myMathJourney/02/)

# 02 - Formative Years

* hardly spoke in school until 11 years of age
  * felt like I was processing all the time but too slowly
  * failed every subject, didn't know why I went to school, etc..
* moved to an experimental boarding (Upanashadic-British) school in Nilgiris *Arsha Vidya Vanam*
  * had to be part of the process - boil water, shower, meditate, yoga, Gita sermons, tea, breakfast, ...
  * Days-scholar in *British-style convent* -- enjoyed geometry, languages, science, ...
  * became a better student nearly "over-night"...
